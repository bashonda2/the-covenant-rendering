## Quick Start

Each chapter is a standalone JSON file:

```

├── chapter-02.json
├── ...
└── chapter-50.json
```

### Example: Genesis 1:1

```json
{
  "verse": 1,
  "text_hebrew": "בְּרֵאשִׁ֖ית בָּרָ֣א אֱלֹהִ֑ים אֵ֥ת הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם וְאֵ֥ת הָאָֽרֶץ׃",
  "text_kjv": "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.",
  "rendering": "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.",
  "translator_notes": [
    "'Heavens' (plural) reflects the Hebrew hashamayim, which is grammatically plural...",
    "The Hebrew reshit means 'beginning' or 'first.' Whether this refers to an absolute beginning or a relative beginning ('When God began to create...') is debated..."
  ],
  "key_terms": [
    {
      "hebrew": "בָּרָא",
      "transliteration": "bara",
      "rendered_as": "created",
      "semantic_range": "created, shaped, brought into being",
      "note": "This verb is used exclusively with God as its subject in the Hebrew Bible..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Statistics

- **50 chapters** — the complete Book of Genesis
- **1,534 verses** — every verse rendered with notes
- **Source text:** Westminster Leningrad Codex (WLC)
- **Reading level:** 9th–10th grade (comparable to ESV)
- **Translation approach:** Formal equivalence with clarity

## Translation Philosophy

The Covenant Rendering follows a **formal equivalence** ("word-for-word") approach as its baseline, but prioritizes clarity over wooden literalism. Key principles:

- **Translate from the Hebrew, not from the KJV.** The KJV is provided as a reference for readers, not as a source text.
- **Preserve ambiguity when it exists.** If the Hebrew is genuinely ambiguous, the rendering preserves that ambiguity and documents the options in translator notes.
- **Modernize vocabulary, not theology.** Archaic English is updated; theological meaning is not changed.
- **Document everything.** Every significant translation decision is explained in the notes.

### Theologically Rich Terms

Some Hebrew words carry a depth of meaning that no single English word can capture. For these terms — including חֶסֶד (*chesed*, "steadfast love"), בְּרִית (*berit*, "covenant"), אֱמוּנָה (*emunah*, "faithfulness"), and גֹּאֵל (*go'el*, "redeemer") — the rendering includes an `expanded_rendering` field that explains what a Hebrew reader would naturally understand that an English reader misses.

## How It Was Made

The Covenant Rendering was generated by Claude (Anthropic's AI model) using a detailed master prompt that specifies translation philosophy, source texts, output format, and theological term handling. The generation prompts are included in the `prompts/` directory for full transparency.

Each chapter was independently reviewed for:
- Hebrew accuracy and key term handling
- Theological depth and cross-referencing
- Rendering quality and reading level
- JSON structure and completeness
