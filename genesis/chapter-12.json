        "'Go forth' translates lekh-lekha (לֶךְ לְךָ), one of the most famous phrases in the Hebrew Bible. Literally 'go for yourself' or 'go to yourself.' The lekha intensifier can mean: (1) 'go by yourself' (alone); (2) 'go for your own benefit' (it will be good for you); (3) 'go to/into yourself' (a journey of self-discovery). The phrase appears only twice in God's commands to Abraham — here and in 22:2 ('go to the land of Moriah'), framing Abraham's entire narrative between two journeys of radical obedience.",
        "The command requires a threefold separation: from land (erets — national identity), from kindred (moledeth — tribal/extended family identity), and from father's house (beit av — immediate family identity). Each successive term is more intimate than the last. Abram is called to leave everything that defines him socially, culturally, and personally.",
        "'To the land that I will show you' (el-ha'arets asher ar'ekka) — the destination is unnamed. Abram is told to go but not told where. This is faith as trust — obedience without full knowledge, departure without a clear destination."

The one who 'makes light of' or dishonors Abram will receive the full divine curse (arar).

The verb nivrekhu can be parsed as niphal ('will be blessed') or hitpael ('will bless themselves'). The niphal reading (passive) means that blessing will come to all nations through Abram; the hitpael reading (reflexive) means nations will invoke Abram's name when blessing themselves ('may I be blessed like Abram'). Both senses are theologically significant. The rendering follows the niphal passive.",
        "'All the families of the earth' (kol mishpechot ha'adamah) — not only nations but families, clans, kinship groups. The scope is universal: what began with the particular (one man, one family) is aimed at the universal (every family on the ground/adamah). The promise reverses the curse of the ground (adamah) pronounced in 3:17 and the scattering of Babel (11:8)."

The ethical reversal is striking: the recipient of God's promise behaves worse than the foreigner. This pattern recurs in 20:9–10 (Abimelech rebukes Abraham) and 26:10 (Abimelech rebukes Isaac).",
