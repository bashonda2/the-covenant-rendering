It indicates that by this point, the chieftainships were associated with specific territories rather than just personal authority.",
        "This final list of chiefs (vv. 40-43) differs from the earlier list (vv. 15-19). The earlier list named chiefs who were Esau's grandsons; this list appears to represent a later period when the chieftainships had evolved into territorial designations. Some names here (Timna, Kenaz, Teman) appear both as personal names and as regional names."
