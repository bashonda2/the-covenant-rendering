      "translator_notes": [
        "'Crafty' translates arum (עָרוּם), which can mean 'shrewd,' 'prudent,' 'cunning,' or 'crafty.' In Proverbs, arum is a positive quality — the shrewd or prudent person (Proverbs 12:16, 23; 13:16; 14:8, 15, 18; 22:3; 27:12). Here the context gives it a negative edge. The crucial wordplay with 2:25 is that arummim ('naked') and arum ('crafty') sound nearly identical in Hebrew. The chapter transition pivots on this pun: the man and woman were arummim (naked/innocent); the serpent is arum (crafty/shrewd). Innocence and cunning are placed side by side, and the narrative tension unfolds between them.",
        "The serpent is identified as one of the wild animals that God made — it is a creature, not a deity or cosmic rival. The text does not identify the serpent as Satan; that identification develops later in Jewish and Christian tradition (cf. Wisdom 2:24; Revelation 12:9; 20:2). The rendering follows the text as it stands.",
        "The serpent's opening question is rhetorically distorted. God's actual command (2:16–17) was generous: 'You may freely eat from every tree of the garden' except one. The serpent reframes it as a blanket prohibition: 'You shall not eat from any tree?' The distortion invites the woman to correct it — and in doing so, to engage in a conversation about God's command on the serpent's terms.",
        "The serpent refers to 'God' (Elohim), not 'the LORD God' (YHWH Elohim) as the narrator and God himself do throughout chapters 2–3. The omission of the personal covenant name may be significant — the serpent depersonalizes God, referring to him by his generic title rather than his relational name.",
        "'Did God really say' translates aph ki-amar Elohim (אַף כִּי־אָמַר אֱלֹהִים). The particle aph (אַף) introduces surprise, incredulity, or emphasis — 'Really? Is it true that...?' The serpent's tone casts doubt not on God's existence but on his word and his character."

(2) She softens the death penalty from 'you will certainly die' (mot tamut, an emphatic infinitive absolute construction in 2:17) to 'or you will die' (pen temutun, פֶּן תְּמֻתוּן — 'lest you die'), removing the emphasis. (3) She follows the serpent in using 'God' (Elohim) rather than 'the LORD God' (YHWH Elohim).

It can mean: (1) 'like God' — like the one God who has been the subject throughout; (2) 'like gods' or 'like divine beings' — a more general category. The KJV renders 'as gods' (lowercase). Since the serpent is speaking about the specific God (Elohim) who gave the command, 'like God' is used here. The ambiguity is noted.",

Ironically, God himself will confirm in 3:22 that the humans have indeed gained this knowledge. The serpent's statement contains a partial truth, which makes it more dangerous than a simple lie: they will know good and evil, but the knowledge will not make them like God in the way the serpent implies."

      "translator_notes": [
        "The woman's evaluation of the tree follows a threefold pattern: (1) 'good for food' (tov lema'akhal) — physical appetite; (2) 'a delight to the eyes' (ta'avah-hu la'einayim) — aesthetic desire; (3) 'desirable for gaining wisdom' (nechmad lehaskil) — intellectual/spiritual aspiration. This threefold appeal — body, eyes, mind — is often compared to 1 John 2:16 ('the desire of the flesh, the desire of the eyes, and the pride of life').",
        "The word nechmad ('desirable') in 'desirable for gaining wisdom' is the same word used in 2:9 to describe all the trees God made: 'every tree that is pleasing (nechmad) to look at.' The forbidden tree shares the same desirability as God's good provision — the temptation lies not in some obviously repulsive thing but in something genuinely attractive.",
        "'Who was with her' (immah, עִמָּהּ) indicates that the man was present. The text does not describe him as absent during the conversation with the serpent and then arriving later — he was 'with her.' His silence throughout the exchange is striking. He does not correct the serpent's distortion, does not invoke God's command, does not refuse the fruit. He simply takes and eats.",
        "The act itself is described with devastating brevity: 'she took... she ate... she gave... he ate.' Four verbs, no elaboration, no internal dialogue, no described hesitation. The narrative restraint is powerful — the most consequential human act in the story is told in the fewest words."

The hitpael form suggests 'walking about,' 'strolling,' or 'going back and forth' — a leisurely, habitual presence, not a sudden arrival. This implies that God's presence in the garden was a regular occurrence, not a special visitation.

The same verb is used for both parties — the offspring strikes the serpent's head, and the serpent strikes the offspring's heel — but the targets differ. A strike to the head is potentially fatal; a strike to the heel is painful but not lethal. The asymmetry suggests that the conflict, while mutual, ultimately favors the woman's offspring.",

        "'Drove out' translates vayegaresh (וַיְגָרֶשׁ), from garash (גָּרַשׁ), a strong verb meaning 'to drive out, to expel, to banish, to divorce.' It is stronger than 'sent out' (shalach, v. 23). Garash is used for driving out inhabitants from a land (Exodus 23:28–31), for divorce (Leviticus 21:7, 14), and for the expulsion of Hagar (Genesis 21:10). The expulsion from Eden is not a gentle departure but a forcible removal.",
        "'Stationed' translates vayyashken (וַיַּשְׁכֵּן), from shakan (שָׁכַן, 'to dwell, to settle, to cause to dwell'). God causes the cherubim to dwell or take up permanent residence at the garden's entrance. The same root gives rise to the word Shekinah (the divine dwelling presence) in later Jewish theology.",
        "'Cherubim' translates keruvim (כְּרֻבִים), heavenly beings associated with God's throne and the guarding of sacred space. In later biblical texts, cherubim are depicted on the ark of the covenant (Exodus 25:18–22), woven into the curtains of the tabernacle (Exodus 26:1, 31), and carved in the temple (1 Kings 6:23–28). They are guardians of holy space — the same function they perform here at the entrance to Eden. Their presence reinforces the garden-as-sanctuary interpretation.",
        "'A flaming sword that turned in every direction' (lahat hacherev hammithappekhet, לַהַט הַחֶרֶב הַמִּתְהַפֶּכֶת) — literally 'the flame of the sword, the one turning itself.' Whether the sword is a separate entity from the cherubim or wielded by them is not specified. The hitpael form of haphakh ('turning itself') suggests autonomous, ceaseless rotation — a perpetually revolving blade of fire blocking all approach.",
        "'To guard the way to the tree of life' (lishmor et-derekh ets hachayyim) — the verb shamar ('to guard') is the same verb used in 2:15 for the man's commission to 'keep/guard' the garden. The profound irony is unmistakable: the man was placed in the garden to shamar (guard) it, and now cherubim shamar (guard) it against him. The guardian has become the one guarded against. What the man failed to protect is now protected from the man."
