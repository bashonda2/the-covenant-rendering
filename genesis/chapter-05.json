Noach is related to nuach (נוּחַ, 'to rest'), but Lamech's explanation uses the verb nacham (נָחַם, 'to comfort, to bring relief'). The sound connection (noach/yenachamenu) creates the wordplay even though the roots differ: Noah ('rest') will 'comfort/relieve' (nacham) them. 'Relief' is used to capture the nuach/nacham overlap.",

Lamech's lament explicitly references the curse of 3:17 ('the ground that the LORD has cursed') — the consequences of the fall are still felt and still lamented generations later.",
