The three verbs (fell, wept, kissed) form a cascade of mourning that is both dignified and deeply emotional. This is the son who was separated from his father for over twenty years, who wept at their reunion (46:29), and who now weeps at the final parting.",
        "The intimacy of 'falling on his face' (al-penei aviv) contrasts with Joseph's public role as Egypt's vizier. In this moment he is not the powerful governor but simply a bereaved son. Throughout the Joseph narrative, private grief punctuates public authority — Joseph has wept more than any other figure in Genesis."
