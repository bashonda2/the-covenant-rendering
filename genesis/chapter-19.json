        "The visitors are now identified as mal'akhim ('angels,' literally 'messengers'), whereas in 18:2 they were called anashim ('men').

The third, who spoke as the LORD, apparently did not accompany them to Sodom.",
        "'Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom' (veLot yoshev besha'ar Sedom) — the gate was the civic center where legal transactions, judgments, and public business took place (cf. Ruth 4:1; Proverbs 31:23). That Lot 'sits' there suggests he has attained a position of civic authority or at least social standing in Sodom. This contrasts sharply with his original status as a 'sojourner' (ger), a tension the mob will exploit in verse 9.",
        "Lot's hospitality mirrors Abraham's in chapter 18 — rising, bowing, offering shelter — but the contrast between the two settings (Mamre's oaks vs. Sodom's gate) signals that everything here will go differently."

Their willingness to stay outside underscores that they do not fear the city's inhabitants; they are there as agents of judgment.",

This is not an accidental glimpse over the shoulder but a deliberate turning to look. She violated the explicit command of verse 17: 'Do not look behind you.' Her look back signifies attachment to what was being destroyed — longing for the city, its life, its comforts. Jesus will cite her as a warning: 'Remember Lot's wife' (Luke 17:32).",

The Dead Sea region is rich in salt formations, and pillar-shaped salt deposits exist to this day along its southern shore. The transformation is both judgment and monument — she who turned to look became a permanent marker of the consequences of divided loyalty.",
