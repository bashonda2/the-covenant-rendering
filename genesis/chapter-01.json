        "This verse is structured as Hebrew poetry — three parallel lines, each using the verb bara ('created'). The threefold repetition of bara is emphatic and unique in this chapter; no other creative act receives this level of emphasis. The poetic structure is preserved in the rendering with line breaks.",
        "The shift from singular 'him' (oto, אֹתוֹ) to plural 'them' (otam, אֹתָם) within the same verse is significant. It reflects the movement from adam as a collective singular ('humanity') to the concrete reality of male and female individuals. Both male and female together constitute the 'image of God' — the image is not limited to one sex.",
        "'Male and female' (zakhar unqevah, זָכָר וּנְקֵבָה) are biological terms — zakhar ('male,' literally 'the one who is remembered/marked') and neqevah ('female,' literally 'the one who is pierced/bored'). These terms emphasize the sexual differentiation of humanity as part of God's creative design.",
        "The verb bara ('created') appears three times in this single verse — and only three other times in the entire chapter (vv. 1, 21, and here). Its concentration in this verse underscores that the creation of humanity is the climactic act of divine creation."

        "The blessing and commission to humanity echoes the blessing given to the sea creatures and birds in verse 22, but with significant additions: 'subdue' the earth and 'rule over' all living creatures. Humanity shares the blessing of fertility with the animals but receives a unique mandate of governance.",
        "'Fill' translates mil'u (מִלְאוּ). The KJV's 'replenish' reflected 17th-century English where 'replenish' simply meant 'fill' (not 'fill again'). The Hebrew carries no implication of refilling something previously filled.",
        "'Subdue' translates kivshuha (וְכִבְשֻׁהָ), from the root k-v-sh (כָּבַשׁ), which is a strong verb meaning 'to subdue, to bring under control, to conquer.' Elsewhere it is used for subjugating enemies (Numbers 32:22, 29) or forcing someone into servitude (Nehemiah 5:5; Jeremiah 34:11, 16). Its strength has generated much discussion about humanity's relationship to the earth — whether this authorizes exploitation or responsible management. The text presents it as a divine commission within the context of a creation pronounced 'very good.'",
        "'Rule' translates redu (וּרְדוּ), the imperative of radah, the same verb used in verse 26. Here it is addressed directly to humanity as a command."
