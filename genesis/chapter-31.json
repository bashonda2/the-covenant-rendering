        "'Kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them' (vaynashek levanav velivnotav vayevarekh ethem) — Laban's final act is one of genuine tenderness. Whatever his faults — and the narrative has catalogued them extensively — Laban is a grandfather saying goodbye to family he will never see again. The verb barakh ('blessed') is the last word Laban speaks over his family. The man who tried to control, exploit, and pursue ends with a blessing and a departure.",
        "'Returned to his place' (vayyashov Lavan limqomo) — Laban exits the narrative permanently. He returns to Paddan-aram, to his household gods (if Rachel has left any), to his diminished flocks. The phrase limqomo ('to his place') carries finality — this is where Laban belongs, and Jacob does not. The boundary has been drawn; the separation is complete. Jacob's Haran chapter is over."
