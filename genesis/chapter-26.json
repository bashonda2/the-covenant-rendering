The term 'Philistines' here is likely anachronistic, referring to pre-Philistine populations in the coastal region who were later identified with the Sea Peoples' Philistine culture."

The double naming — once by Abraham, once by Isaac — reinforces the continuity between the generations. Both father and son made treaties at this location, both dug wells, and both connected the place to an oath. The phrase 'to this day' (ad hayyom hazzeh) is the narrator's signature, connecting the ancient event to the reader's present."

        "'Forty years old' — the same age at which Isaac married (25:20). But where Isaac's marriage was divinely guided and covenantally appropriate, Esau's marriages are impulsive and covenantally disastrous. The age parallel highlights the contrast: same milestone, opposite outcomes.",
        "'Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite' — Esau takes two wives simultaneously, both from the Hittite population. This directly violates the principle Abraham insisted upon in chapter 24: the covenant heir must not marry Canaanite women. Esau's marriages reveal his disregard for covenantal identity — the same carelessness that led him to sell his birthright. The Hittites (or more precisely, the 'sons of Heth') are the local Canaanite population from whom Abraham purchased the cave of Machpelah."

Despite their divided loyalties regarding their sons (25:28), Isaac and Rebekah are united in their distress over Esau's marriages. This detail prepares for 27:46, where Rebekah's anguish over the Hittite wives becomes the pretext for sending Jacob to Paddan-aram. Esau's marriages demonstrate that he is temperamentally and spiritually unsuited to carry the covenant forward — he has no regard for the family's covenantal distinctiveness."
