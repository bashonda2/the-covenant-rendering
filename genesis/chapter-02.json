        "This is the first human speech in the Bible, and it is poetry. The man's response to seeing the woman is not a clinical observation but a poetic exclamation — structured verse with parallelism and wordplay. The poetic form is preserved in the rendering with line breaks and indentation.",
        "'This one, at last' translates zot happa'am (זֹאת הַפַּעַם), literally 'this one, this time.' After reviewing all the animals and finding no suitable counterpart (vv. 19–20), the man's exclamation expresses recognition, delight, and relief. 'At last' captures the sense of arrival after searching.",
        "'Bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh' (etsem me'atsamai uvasar mibbesari) is an expression of kinship and identity. The same formula appears in other kinship contexts (Genesis 29:14; Judges 9:2; 2 Samuel 5:1; 19:12–13). The woman is not a stranger or a different kind of creature — she shares the man's very substance.",
        "The wordplay between ishah (אִשָּׁה, 'woman') and ish (אִישׁ, 'man') is a folk etymology — a meaningful wordplay rather than a strict linguistic derivation. Linguistically, ishah likely derives from a different root than ish (ishah from '-n-sh, ish from '-y-sh), but the text presents a deliberate sound-correspondence: she is ishah because she was taken from ish. The English 'woman' / 'man' (or historically 'wo-man' from 'wif-man') offers a partial parallel. No English rendering can fully reproduce the Hebrew wordplay."

        "This verse shifts from narrative to a general principle — it is the narrator's comment (or possibly God's pronouncement) drawing a universal conclusion from the particular event. The shift from past-tense narrative to future-tense principle ('a man will leave') is marked by 'for this reason' (al-ken, עַל־כֵּן), which connects the institution of marriage to the creation of woman from man.",
        "'Hold fast' translates davaq (דָּבַק), meaning 'to cling, to cleave, to stick to, to adhere.' This is a strong verb of attachment and loyalty. It is used elsewhere for clinging to God in covenant faithfulness (Deuteronomy 10:20; 11:22; 13:5; 30:20; Joshua 22:5; 23:8). The word implies permanent, tenacious bonding — not merely living together but becoming inseparable. The KJV's 'cleave' captures the strength but is archaic.",
        "'One flesh' (basar echad, בָּשָׂר אֶחָד) describes the union of husband and wife. The phrase encompasses physical union (sexual intimacy), but its meaning is broader — a comprehensive merging of life, identity, and purpose. The two become a single social and relational unit. The same word basar ('flesh') was used in verse 23 ('flesh of my flesh'), connecting the one-flesh union to the woman's origin from the man's own flesh.",

        "'Naked' translates arummim (עֲרוּמִּים), the plural of arom (עָרוֹם). This word sets up one of the most important wordplays in Genesis: the next verse (3:1) introduces the serpent as arum (עָרוּם, 'crafty' or 'shrewd'). The near-homophony between arummim ('naked') and arum ('crafty') creates a literary bridge between the innocence of chapter 2 and the deception of chapter 3. The connection is audible in Hebrew but invisible in English translation.",
        "'Felt no shame' translates velo yitboshashu (וְלֹא יִתְבֹּשָׁשׁוּ), from the root b-w-sh (בּוֹשׁ, 'to be ashamed'). The hitpael form (reflexive/reciprocal) suggests 'they were not ashamed before each other' — there was no self-consciousness, no need for concealment or protection in their mutual vulnerability. This state of unashamed nakedness represents the original condition of human relationship — complete transparency and trust. The loss of this condition is narrated in 3:7–10.",
        "This verse concludes chapter 2 and functions as a narrative hinge: it simultaneously describes the final state of innocence and foreshadows its loss. The chapter ends in a state of wholeness — harmonious relationship with God, with each other, and with creation — that chapter 3 will disrupt."
