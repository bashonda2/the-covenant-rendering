The dimness of his eyes mirrors a dimness of spiritual discernment.",

It is not a prayer (which can be offered for anyone, anytime) but a bestowal of covenantal inheritance, which is finite.",
        "'And Esau lifted up his voice and wept' (vayyissa Esav qolo vayyevk) — the same phrase used of Hagar in the wilderness (21:16). Esau weeps like the outcast he is becoming. This is not the cry of rage (that comes in v. 41) but the cry of grief — the sound of a man who has lost something irreplaceable and knows it. The text grants Esau genuine pathos. Whatever his faults — selling the birthright carelessly (25:34) — his grief here is treated as real and legitimate."

It can mean 'from' (partitive: 'of the fatness') or 'away from' (privative: 'far from the fatness'). The KJV and some translations read it as partitive — Esau will enjoy the earth's richness. But the rendering follows the privative reading, which better fits the context: Esau's 'blessing' is an inversion of Jacob's. Where Jacob receives the dew and fatness (v. 28), Esau is deprived of them. Edom's territory — the arid highlands south and east of the Dead Sea — confirms the privative reading geographically."

        "'When you grow restless, you shall break his yoke' (ka'asher tarid ufaraqta ullo me'al tsavvarekha) — the verb tarid (from rud, 'to roam, to be restless, to rebel') suggests that Esau's servitude is not permanent. When he chafes enough, he will throw off Jacob's dominion. This was fulfilled historically when Edom revolted against Judah's rule (2 Kings 8:20–22). Isaac's prophecy for Esau contains both servitude and eventual liberation — a cruel consolation, but not total despair."

It implies not a flash of anger but a settled, enduring hatred — animosity that calculates and waits. The same verb describes Joseph's brothers' fear that Joseph will 'bear a grudge' against them (50:15). Grudge-bearing is the slow poison of Genesis's family narratives.",
        "'Esau said in his heart' (vayyomer Esav belibbo) — internal speech, accessible only to the narrator (and to God). Esau's plan is private, but Rebekah somehow learns of it (v. 42). The plan is chilling in its restraint: Esau will wait until after the mourning period for Isaac before killing Jacob. He honors his father even while plotting fratricide — a terrible mix of filial piety and murderous rage. The echo of Cain (4:8) is unmistakable: brother planning to kill brother."
