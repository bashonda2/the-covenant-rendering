The wound is permanent, a bodily reminder that the blessing came through struggle, not ease. The limp is the mark of encounter — like a scar, it tells a story. Israel's relationship with God begins not in perfection but in brokenness. The patriarch of the nation walks wounded into his future."

This rendering follows the Hebrew verse numbering throughout.",
        "'Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and there was Esau coming' (vayyissa Ya'aqov einav vayyar vehinneh Esav ba) — the moment of confrontation arrives. Jacob, limping from the night's encounter, now sees the brother he has feared for twenty years. The 'four hundred men' (arba-me'ot ish) are still present — the military threat has not diminished. But Jacob is no longer the same man who sent the messengers. He has wrestled with God and survived; he faces Esau with a new name and a wounded hip. The division of children — placing each group with its mother — is both practical (organizing the procession) and protective (distributing risk). The narrative bridges directly into the reunion of chapter 33."
