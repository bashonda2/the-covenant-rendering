        "'Give me children — if not, I am dying!' (havah-li vanim ve'im-ayin metah anokhi) — Rachel's cry is one of the most emotionally raw statements in Genesis. The verb havah ('give!') is an imperative demand — the same word Jacob used to demand his wife from Laban (29:21). Now Rachel demands from Jacob what only God can give. Her words echo ancient Rachel's anguish but also reveal a theological confusion: she addresses Jacob as though he controls fertility.",
        "The phrase 'I am dying' (metah anokhi) uses the participle — 'I am in the process of dying,' not a future threat but a present experience. Barrenness in the ancient Near East was not merely a private sorrow; it was social death, a failure of identity in a culture where a woman's worth was measured in sons. Rachel's desperation is existential, not merely emotional."

      "translator_notes": [
        "'Am I in the place of God?' (hathachat Elohim anokhi) — Jacob's theological response is correct but pastorally brutal. He rightly identifies God as the source of fertility (cf. 29:31, where the LORD opens Leah's womb), but he delivers this truth in anger rather than compassion. The question is rhetorical and cutting — the answer is obviously 'no.' Jacob deflects Rachel's pain rather than entering into it. His response contrasts sharply with Isaac, who 'prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife' when Rebekah was barren (25:21).",
        "'The fruit of the womb' (peri-vaten) — the metaphor of children as 'fruit' links human fertility to agricultural abundance. The womb (beten) produces fruit (peri) as the earth produces harvest — both are God's domain. The phrase will reappear in blessings and curses throughout Deuteronomy."

Luz ('almond' or 'hazel') connects to the name of the place where Jacob had his Bethel vision (28:19, 'the city was formerly called Luz').

Jacob creates striped visual stimuli for the animals at the watering troughs where they breed. Whether this 'works' by natural means or by divine intervention behind the folk practice is left ambiguous — but 31:10–12 later reveals that God directed the outcome through a dream."
