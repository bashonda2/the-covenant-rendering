The etymology of Shaddai is debated: it may derive from shadad ('to overpower'), from shad ('mountain'), or from a cognate meaning 'breast' (suggesting nourishment and sufficiency). The Septuagint renders it pantokrator ('Almighty'). Whatever its origin, the title emphasizes God's sovereign power — the very power needed to fulfill promises that seem biologically impossible.",
