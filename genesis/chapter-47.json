        "'Place your hand under my thigh' (sim-na yadekha tachat yerekhi) — this solemn oath gesture appears only twice in Scripture: here and when Abraham's servant swore regarding Isaac's bride (24:2, 9). The thigh (yarekh) is associated with procreative power and descendants. By placing his hand there, Joseph swears by Jacob's offspring — by the covenant future itself. The gesture binds the oath to the most sacred dimension of family continuity.",
        "'Steadfast love and faithfulness' (chesed ve'emet) — this paired expression describes covenant loyalty enacted in truth. Chesed is lovingkindness that exceeds obligation; emet is reliability, trustworthiness, fidelity. Together they describe the highest form of interpersonal commitment. Jacob asks Joseph not merely for a favor but for an act of covenantal faithfulness.",
        "'Do not bury me in Egypt' (al-na tiqbereni beMitsrayim) — Jacob's insistence on burial outside Egypt is not merely sentimental. It is a theological statement: Egypt is not home. The land of promise, where Abraham and Isaac are buried, is where Jacob's body must rest. His burial there is an act of faith in God's promise that Israel will return to Canaan."

        "'Israel bowed in worship at the head of the bed' (vayyishtachu Yisra'el al-rosh hamittah) — the verb hishtachavah means to bow down in worship or reverence. Jacob, too frail to rise, worships God from his bed. The LXX (Septuagint) reads 'upon the top of his staff' (matteh instead of mittah), which Hebrews 11:21 follows. Whether bed or staff, the image is the same: a dying patriarch worshipping God in gratitude that his burial in the promised land is secured.",
        "The switch from 'Jacob' (the human name) to 'Israel' (the covenant name) at this climactic moment is significant. It is Israel — the one who wrestled with God and prevailed — who worships at the end. The covenant identity has the final word."
