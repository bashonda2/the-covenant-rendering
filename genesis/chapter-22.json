        "'God tested' (ha'Elohim nissah) — the verb nissah means 'to test, to prove, to try.' The narrator tells the reader at the outset what Abraham himself does not know: this is a test, not a final directive. The definite article on Elohim (ha'Elohim, 'the God') is unusual and may emphasize the absolute, sovereign God — the One who has the right to test. The KJV's 'tempt' follows older English usage where 'tempt' could mean 'test' (cf. James 1:13, where God 'tempts no one' to evil). The rendering uses 'tested' to avoid the modern connotation of enticement to sin.",
        "'Here I am' (hineni) — the first of three hineni responses in this chapter (also v. 7 and v. 11). This single Hebrew word — 'behold me' — expresses total availability and readiness. It is the posture of the servant who holds nothing back. Abraham answers before knowing what will be asked. His availability precedes the content of the command.",
        "'After these things' (achar haddevarim ha'elleh) — a transitional formula that creates temporal distance. What 'things'? The birth of Isaac, the expulsion of Ishmael, the treaty with Abimelech. Abraham has settled into a life of relative peace. The test comes not in the midst of crisis but in the calm after it — when Abraham has the most to lose."

This silence is either the deepest faith or the deepest agony, or both.",

In the narrative itself, the plural may express Abraham's trust that God will somehow resolve the contradiction between the command to sacrifice and the promise that 'through Isaac your offspring will be named' (21:12).

Abraham does return — and notably, Isaac is not mentioned. The silence about Isaac's return has puzzled interpreters. In the midrash, some traditions say Isaac went to study at the academy of Shem; the narrative simply leaves him unmentioned, perhaps because the focus remains tightly on Abraham's faith journey, which began and ends at Beersheba.",
        "'They went together' (vayyelekhuu yachdav) — the word yachdav ('together') appears for the third time in the chapter (cf. vv. 6, 8), but now the 'together' has shifted from father and son to Abraham and his servants. The community of the journey reforms around the patriarch, and life resumes.",
        "'Abraham dwelt at Beersheba' — the narrative returns to its starting point (21:33–34). The drama of Moriah is over; Abraham resumes the life of a sojourner in the Negev. The most extraordinary event of his life yields to the most ordinary continuation. Faith returns to daily life."
