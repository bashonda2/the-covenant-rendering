Joseph will dominate Genesis 37-50; Benjamin will become the tribe of Israel's first king (Saul). The brevity of this entry — just two names — contrasts with the lengthy narrative devoted to Rachel's story."

The order 'Esau and Jacob' (not Jacob and Esau) may reflect Esau's status as the elder, or his geographic proximity to Hebron (he is in Seir, closer than wherever Jacob was). The burial scene suggests at least functional reconciliation — the brothers can share this sacred duty even if their paths will now diverge permanently."
