It was the firstborn's most precious possession. Jacob's willingness to barter food for this treasure reveals his understanding of its value — an understanding Esau conspicuously lacks."

        "'I am about to die' (hinneh anokhi holekh lamut) — literally, 'Behold, I am going to die.' Esau's self-assessment is almost certainly hyperbolic: he is hungry and tired, not mortally endangered. But his words reveal a man who lives entirely in the present moment, with no capacity for long-term thinking. A birthright has value only to someone who can imagine a future; Esau cannot see past his current hunger.",
        "'What good is a birthright to me?' (velammah-zeh li bekhorah) — the question is devastating in its shortsightedness. Esau dismisses the birthright as worthless because it cannot satisfy his immediate physical need. The narrator will render judgment on this attitude in v. 34. Hebrews 12:16 later calls Esau a 'profane person' (bebelos) for this act — one who treats the sacred as common."

The machine-gun pacing conveys Esau's total lack of reflection. There is no pause, no moment of regret, no hesitation. He consumes and departs as though nothing of consequence has occurred.",
        "'So Esau despised his birthright' (vayyivez Esav et-habbekhorah) — the narrator's verdict is devastating. The verb bazah means to despise, to regard as worthless, to treat with contempt. It is a word of moral judgment. Esau did not merely sell his birthright; he despised it. He assigned it zero value. This editorial comment transforms a story about a hungry man and a clever brother into a theological parable about the difference between those who value the sacred and those who do not."
