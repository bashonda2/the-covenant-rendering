After the Bethel theophany, Jacob does not merely 'journey' — he lifts his feet, as if the divine encounter has given him new energy and resolve. The expression suggests eagerness, even lightness: the man who slept on a stone pillow and saw heaven opened now walks with purpose. The Targum Onqelos paraphrases 'he went quickly,' capturing the sense of joyful haste.",
        "'The land of the people of the east' (artsah benei-qedem) — benei qedem ('sons of the east') designates the region of upper Mesopotamia, the ancestral homeland. Jacob leaves the promised land for the first time, heading toward the family he has never met. The journey reverses Abraham's migration: Abraham left the east for Canaan, Jacob now returns east. This pattern of exile and return will define Israel's story."

        "'Judah' (Yehudah) — from yadah ('to praise, to give thanks'). The name that will define Israel's royal tribe, the kingdom of Judah, and eventually the term 'Jew' (Yehudi) originates in an unloved woman's praise. The line from Judah to David to the messianic hope begins here, in Leah's declaration of praise born from suffering. That the most consequential of Jacob's sons comes from the wife he did not choose is Genesis at its most theologically subversive.",
        "'She ceased bearing' (vatta'amod milledet) — literally 'she stood from bearing,' meaning she stopped. This pause sets up the rivalry and surrogacy arrangements of chapter 30. The cessation is temporary — Leah will bear again (30:17–20) — but it creates the dramatic space for Rachel's anguish and the competition that follows."
