        "'The years of the life of Sarah' (shenei chayyei Sarah) — the closing phrase repeats and summarizes the opening, a solemn literary envelope. The Hebrew breaks the number into three segments — 'one hundred years and twenty years and seven years' — with the word shanah ('year') repeated after each unit, which is unusual. The Midrash (Genesis Rabbah 58:1) famously interprets this: at one hundred she was like twenty in beauty, and at twenty she was like seven in sinlessness. Whether or not one follows the homiletical reading, the structure is deliberate and dignified, marking Sarah as the only woman in the Torah whose age at death is recorded.",
        "Sarah is 127 years old. Since she was 90 when Isaac was born (17:17), Isaac is now 37. This chronological marker places the Akedah (chapter 22) shortly before Sarah's death in the narrative sequence, though the text does not explicitly connect the two events."

For comparison, Jeremiah later bought a field at Anathoth for 17 shekels (Jeremiah 32:9), David bought the threshing floor of Araunah for 50 shekels (2 Samuel 24:24), and Omri purchased the hill of Samaria for two talents (about 6,000 shekels, but for a much larger parcel — 1 Kings 16:24). Four hundred shekels for a field with a cave is exorbitant. Ephron's affected nonchalance ('What is that between friends?') masks a shrewd asking price.",
        "The rhetorical strategy is classic ANE bargaining: the extravagant offer of a gift (v. 11) was never truly meant to be accepted; it served to place Ephron in a position of magnanimity, from which he now names a very high price that Abraham can hardly refuse without appearing ungrateful."
