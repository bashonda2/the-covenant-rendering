There is a deliberate wordplay: banah ('build') and ben ('son') share the same root (b-n-h / b-n). To 'be built up' through a surrogate is to gain a son — and through a son, a household, a legacy, a future. The wordplay is untranslatable but essential.",

The ambiguity is productive. Ishmael will dwell alongside his kinsmen — Isaac's line — but in a posture of independence, perhaps confrontation. The prophecy anticipates the complex, enduring relationship between the Ishmaelite and Israelite peoples."
