Yir'at Elohim ('the fear of God') is the foundational moral concept in the Hebrew Bible — the reverent awe of God that produces ethical behavior (cf. Proverbs 1:7; 9:10). Abraham assumed that without this fear, no moral restraint would operate, and his life would be forfeit. The assumption was wrong: Abimelech demonstrated precisely the moral integrity Abraham denied him.",
        "The irony is painful. Abraham, the man who walked with God and received the covenant promises, assumed the worst about a people he did not know — while he himself was the one acting without moral integrity. The 'fear of God' Abraham found lacking in Gerar was more conspicuously absent in his own conduct.",
        "'They will kill me on account of my wife' (vaharguniy al-devar ishti) — Abraham's fear, however misguided, was not irrational by ancient Near Eastern standards. A beautiful woman with a living husband posed a problem; a beautiful widow was available. The calculus of self-preservation is understandable, but it reveals a failure to trust the God who had promised him descendants."

Some read it as a genuine plural ('gods caused me to wander'), reflecting Abraham's pre-monotheistic idiom when speaking to a pagan; others see it as a pluralis majestatis or an anomalous construction. The rendering preserves the standard translation 'God caused me to wander,' but the Hebrew is unusual.",

He asked Sarah to make this her permanent practice — at every place they would go.",
