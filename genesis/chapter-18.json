        "The LORD accepts Abraham's premise without dispute. If fifty righteous are found, the entire city will be spared — not just the righteous extracted, but 'the whole place' (kol hamaqom) preserved. The principle is extraordinary: the merit of a righteous minority can preserve a sinful majority.",

This theology of vicarious merit — the few bearing the weight that saves the many — threads through Scripture to its culmination in the Suffering Servant (Isa 53)."
